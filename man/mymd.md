'subsets' relies on the 'Rcpp', 'collapse' and 'data.table' R-packages
 to ensure an acceptable performance of its functions despite the many checks that these functions perform.
 I also recommend using these packages for other subsetting and data wrangling functionalities. list() 
 Besides these package,
 the following R packages work very nicely together with 'subsets':
  

*  'stringi': list()  THE R package for fast and concise string manipulation - an essential part of any programming language. 

*  'abind': list()  Provides binding arrays along an arbitrary dimension. 

*  'tinycodet': list()  Helps the user with their coding etiquette. Focuses on 4 aspects: (1) safe functionalities, (2) an import system that combines benefits of using without attaching and attaching a package, (3) extending the capabilities of the aforementioned 'stringi' package, (4) functions to reduce repetitive code.
